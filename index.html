        <p>Kristen is 11 years old and just started Young Womens. She gets to go to the temple for the first time tomorrow and she is so excited. She loves to go to school, read, and play board games.</p>
        <p>Kayla is 10 years old but she is the taller than her older sister. She loves to play and sing. Kayla has Grave's disease which affects her thyroid and makes her so thin.</p>
        <p>Dallin is 5 years old. He is in Kindergarten and his teacher always says that he is deceptively smart. He loves Disney Cars and would watch the movie all day if I let him.</p>
